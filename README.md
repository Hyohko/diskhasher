# diskhasher

A utility for calculating the checksums of all files on a given disk. If a checksum file is provided, then calculate only the checksums of the files listed and compare them against the give sums, reporting back any failures. For example:

```bash
./diskhasher -d /path/to/folder -f md5sum_destination.txt -a md5 -l ./failures.log
```

This utility will spin up as many new threads as the processor will support to parallelize the computation of checksums.

The preferred build mode uses the Phusion Holy Build Box to build a cross-platform/"portable" binary. This script will pull down the latest Holy Build Box Docker container and execute the build process inside it. This has the advantage of linking against the oldest possible GLIBC that the HBB supports, and should work on anything later than CentOS 7 / Ubuntu 14.04. Execute the following script, which will automatically get the lastest HBB from the Docker hub:

```bash
cd /path/to/diskhasher/
# Rust builds
./execute-hbb-build.sh rust release
./execute-hbb-build.sh rust debug

# C++ Builds
./execute-hbb-build.sh cpp release
./execute-hbb-build.sh cpp debug

./diskhasher .....
```

# Rust

```bash
$ ./diskhasher --help
Recursive directory file hasher - computes cryptographic checksums for every file in a directory.
Supports MD5, SHA1, SHA224, SHA256, SHA384, and SHA512

Usage: diskhasher [OPTIONS] --dir <DIRECTORY> --alg <ALGORITHM>

Options:
  -d, --dir <DIRECTORY>
          Path to the directory we want to validate

          Diskhasher will perform a cryptographic hash on every regular file in this directory and every one of its subdirectories. Symlinks and other non-file entities will be ignored.

  -a, --alg <ALGORITHM>
          Algorithm to use

          Diskhasher currently supports 7 hashing algorithms: MD5, SHA1, SHA224, SHA256, SHA284, and SHA512. Users are encouraged to use more secure algorithms where possible, although MD5 and SHA1 are included for backwards compatibility purposes, despite the fact that they are cryptographically broken and untrustworthy.

          [possible values: md5, sha1, sha224, sha256, sha384, sha512]

  -f, --file-pattern <PATTERN>
          Regex pattern used to identify hashfiles (e.g. md5sum*.txt)

          This regular expression is used to identify hashfiles, i.e. files that were generated by md5sum or its equivalent for other hash algorithms. Each line in a hashfile should be formatted <hash_in_hexadecimal> <relative path to file from this hashfile> or <<hash_in_hexadecimal> <absolute path to file> The parser will canonicalize all paths and validate that each file specified in the hashfile exists or print a relevant error message such as FileNotFound

  -x, --force
          Force computation of hashes even if hash pattern fails or is omitted

          If the --force option is set, then every regular file in the target directory will be hashed even if there is no corresponding entry in an hashfile, and no validation of hashes will be performed.

  -v, --verbose
          Print all results to stdout

          Normally, when a hashfile pattern is set, only hash failures (ones that don't match a hashfile entry) is printed to STDOUT - if verbose is called, print successes and failures.

  -s, --sort <SORTING>
          File sorting order

          Depending on the size of the files in the directory, the user may want to see the largest files sorted first or the smallest. Inode-order hashing is the default method (ostensibly) for disk I/O speed especially on HDD drives to avoid thrashing the read/write heads above the platters.

          [default: inode-order]
          [possible values: largest-first, smallest-first, inode-order]

  -l, --log <LOGFILE>
          [Optional] File to log hashing results

          If provided, the logfile will record the hash results (success/failure) at this provided file location. If no directory is given as part of the file path, then this file will be written to the same directory as the diskhasher executable.

  -j, --jobs <JOBS>
          [Optional] number of jobs (will be capped by number of cores)

          For readability, the number of concurrently running threads performing file hashing is capped at either 12 threads or the max number of CPU cores available, whichever is smaller. The user may optionally run more jobs up to the max number of cores, but be warned that this may make the display unreadable.

  -h, --help
          Print help (see a summary with '-h')

  -V, --version
          Print version
```

To build as statically-linked, default Release mode (runs on most NIX systems):

```bash
cd /path/to/diskhasher/cpp
make

./diskhasher .....
```

To build for Linux using CMAKE (may not work on all systems):

```bash
cd /path/to/diskhasher/cpp
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
make

./diskhasher .....
```

To build on Windows requires CMake and the Windows Visual Studio 2019 development kit (just the compilers and libraries), and you'll need to do all this in the Developer Command Prompt for VS2019:

```cmd
cd C:\path\to\diskhasher\cpp
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 16 2019"
msbuild .\diskhasher.sln /P:Configuration=Release;Platform=x64

% to run %
.\Release\diskhasher.exe ....
```
